Loved it at first, but then it turns out the battery life is disappointing. The camera is nice and takes great pictures. However, today, I dropped it from not very high up on hardwood floor (that isn't that hard) and the back panel (which is glass) completely shattered. Very disappointing, no aluminum casing, but just glass that breaks easily. I can now see the inner components. Google recommended a service that would charge me $400 to fix it (apparently both the back and front panel need to be replaced). $400 to fix for an $800 phone. Something is majorly wrong here.
