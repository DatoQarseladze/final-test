However, today, I dropped it from not very high up on hardwood floor (that isn't that hard) and the back panel (which is glass) completely shattered. Very disappointing, no aluminum casing, but just glass that breaks easily. I can now see the inner components. Google recommended a service that would charge me $400 to fix it (apparently both the back and front panel need to be replaced). $400 to fix for an $800 phone. Something is majorly wrong here. I'm going back to an iPhone, used to have them for many years, they were able to survive gentle drops without any damage. So disappointed in Google!!! Yes I shouldn't have dropped it, but no it shouldn't completely shatter so easily."
